# Codex project instructions

## Nonnegotiable boundaries

- `CommanderEngine` is authoritative. Never let a pilot mutate zones, life, mana, stack, counters, or effects directly.
- Every player command must be authorized by an unconsumed capability issued to that authenticated principal.
- Only the arbiter may submit generic effects, and only while holding an `arbiter.resolve` capability.
- Hidden information must be projected by principal. Never solve a UI issue by exposing full state.
- No Scryfall network calls during a game. Use local SQLite data.
- Unknown Oracle semantics must fail into an arbiter decision; never guess silently.
- A yield is an optimization, never authority to suppress a changed meaningful-action signature. `suppressed_meaningful_windows` must remain zero.
- Pilots select server-advertised ability/cost options. Never restore arbitrary `declared_cost`, `cost_effects`, or uncompiled cast-from-zone input in strict mode.
- Treat `principal` as authenticated transport metadata, never as a seat chosen inside a client command body.
- Keep public protocol objects JSON-serializable, versioned, and hash-resynchronizable.
- The realistic mulligan guard is policy, not a Magic rule; preserve the distinction.
- Codex arena pilots use only their fixed-seat tool surface. Never give a pilot a run path to inspect, another seat's packet/memory, a raw capability, or authoritative checkpoint.
- The primary Codex task may arbitrate public rules context but must never choose a strategic seat action or silently repair a legal poor choice.
- Never label provider/model/thread identity as observed unless it came from an actual invocation. Preserve `null` when the platform does not expose a value.
- Never promote a duplicated-deck fixture or a run with incomplete material semantics to matchup evidence.
- Semantic choices that suspend resolution must persist a versioned,
  replayable frame. Private search candidates go only to the searching seat;
  public records must not reveal a nonrevealed result moved to hand.
- Record summaries and provider counters are derived from journals. Never
  upgrade recorded provider/model identity to verified by inference, and never
  describe accepted-prefix replay as a completed game.
- Product gameplay, rules enforcement, CI, merge gates, and releases must not
  require an LLM, Codex runtime, provider credential, or live AI ruling. An AI
  client is optional and has no authority beyond the ordinary projected client
  protocol.
- Do not spend product slices improving AI strategy, model routing, prompts, or
  provider sessions. Keep existing provider-specific adapters isolated from the
  authoritative rules and application layers.

## Before committing

```bash
python -m compileall -q mtg_commander_sim tests scripts simctl.py
python scripts/build_test_database.py build --fixture tests/fixtures/scryfall-exact-lists.json --output data/test-ci.sqlite3
# Set MTG_CARD_DB=data/test-ci.sqlite3 for the remaining commands.
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python scripts/demo_four_player_protocol.py --db data/test-ci.sqlite3 --out demo
python scripts/update_platform_status.py --check
python scripts/validate_repository.py
python -m build --wheel
python scripts/verify_wheel.py
```

Set `MTG_CARD_DB` when the database is outside `data/`.
Never stage `run/`, a SQLite database, a raw deck cache, a capability-bearing
packet, or a live Game Record. Regression records must be generated in a
temporary directory from sanitized recipes.

## Architecture tests required

Changes touching turns, priority, combat, state-based actions, mulligans, permissions, projection patches, or semantic resolution require regression tests.

Changes touching legal-action generation or yields also require opportunity
journal assertions, a zero-suppression check, and exact replay of the
seed-20260730 fixture.

For a new client feature:

1. reuse or add a capability action
2. project data only to principals that need it
3. update protocol schema and reducer tests
4. keep transport logic out of `CommanderEngine`

For new card semantics:

1. prefer generic DSL operations
2. use runtime placeholders rather than physical object IDs
3. delegate strategic player choices
4. include a deterministic rules test
5. do not hard-code a deck name or commander into the kernel

## Performance targets

- After bootstrap, routine packets should usually remain below 1,000 estimated input tokens.
- Empty known priority windows should make no model call.
- A repeated live decision without a state change should stay below 400 estimated tokens.
- Prefer automatic transitions, yields, and semantic caching over more model calls.
- Preserve patch hash validation; never trade correctness for a smaller unverified delta.
